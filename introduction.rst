Introduction
============

GPU Optimized Monte Carlo (GOMC) is open-source software for simulating many-body molecular systems using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. GOMC is written in object oriented C++, which was chosen since it offers a good balance between code development time, interoperability with existing software elements, and code performance. The software may be compiled as a single-threaded application, a multi-threaded application using OpenMP, or to use many-core heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures using OpenMP and CUDA. GOMC officially supports Windows 7 or newer and most modern distribution of GNU/Linux. This software has the ability to compile on recent versions of macOS; however, such a platform is not officially supported.

GOMC employs widely-used simulation file types (PDB, PSF, CHARMM-style parameter file) and supports polar and non-polar linear and branched molecules. GOMC can be used to study vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria, adsorption in porous materials, surfactant self-assembly, and condensed phase structure for complex molecules.
